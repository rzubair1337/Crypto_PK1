Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) Lab

Public key cryptography is the foundation of todayâ€™s secure communication, but it is subject to man-in-the- middle attacks when one side of communication sends its public key to the other side. The fundamental problem is that there is no easy way to verify the ownership of a public key, i.e., given a public key and its claimed owner information, how do we ensure that the public key is indeed owned by the claimed owner? The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a practical solution to this problem.
